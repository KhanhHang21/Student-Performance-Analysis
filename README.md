# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Analysis

**What factors truly influence student academic success?**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project investigates how student background, parental involvement, study habits, and participation in extracurricular activities impact GPA. By combining exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and predictive modeling, we aim to uncover actionable insights for educators and policy-makers.

## ðŸ“š Background Information

- Student performance is a multi-faceted outcome shaped by both academic and non-academic factors.
- This study explores **absences, parental support, extracurricular activities, and tutoring** as potential predictors of GPA.
- The dataset includes demographic, behavioral, and academic variables collected via surveys and institutional data.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Perform **data cleaning and exploratory analysis** to understand GPA patterns across different groups
- Use **statistical hypothesis testing** (e.g., ANOVA, t-tests) to evaluate the impact of categorical factors on GPA
- Apply **multiple linear regression** to identify and rank key predictors of GPA
- Derive insights and **recommendations for student support strategies**
